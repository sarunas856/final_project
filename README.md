# Beauty Classification- Swipe Left or Right (Based on Tinder)

Data (GDPR - Data Protection Statement) set was created to determine if a CNN could be trained to classify female images into one of two classes, Like or Unlike. In particular I was curious as to how we seem to have a built in pattern recognition system in our brains that differentiates people by their photos on Tinder app. This differentiation can take many forms but one of the most common is our seemingly subconscious classification of beauty. So I decided if a CNN could be trained to make a similar classification. I gathered 1000 images of women from Lithuania on Tinder app to use as the images for the data set. Of course this is MY interpretation of like/unlike which will differ from what others might consider as like/unlike.
